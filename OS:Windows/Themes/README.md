# Windows Themes

These files are stored in the following location(s), and outline the Windows theme settings:
`~\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Themes`

**_Note:_** You will need the wallpaper pictures to be located in the same place, by default, I use:
`%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Documents\Wallpapers\[wallpaper-name].png`
